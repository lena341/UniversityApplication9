## ASP.NET Core Web App with EF Core
This is an ASP.NET Core Web App with EF Core based on the Microsoft Docs tutorial Razor Pages with Entity Framework Core in ASP.NET Core - Tutorial 1 of 8 | Microsoft Docs. 
It is a simple application for the students of Contoso University where they can add their information by submiting a form in Students tab, add a course they are interested in, in
Courses tab and add their direction in Directions tab.
It performes CRUD operations in an Azure SQL Database that runs on an Azure Server. I created a connection to the Azure SQL Database with a connection string that exists in appsettings.json The three classes Student, Course and Direction are in the Models folder.
